# Summary

This is the backend repo for our 2 week project - nc portfolio.

The app has in built user authentication.

# Technology

The front end of the app is built in react native. We used expo-av video player to render the videos and cloudinary to store our video files on. The user authentication is achieved using hashed passwords on our backend data base and becrypt to compare the hashed passwords.
